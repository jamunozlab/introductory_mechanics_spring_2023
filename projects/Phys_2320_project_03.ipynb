        "Nevertheless, Jorginho is complaining that even though he followed the running program closely on 9/18, 9/25, and 10/2, his times are not quite the same you had predicted. You suddendly remember that wikipedia article about [reductionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism) that says: ``reductionist thinking and methods form the basis for many of the well-developed topics of modern science, including much of physics, chemistry and molecular biology. Classical mechanics in particular is seen as a reductionist framework.'' Although you are not sure about ontological reductionism (a belief that the whole of reality consists of a minimal number of parts), methodological reductionism (the scientific attempt to provide an explanation in terms of ever-smaller entities) has proved its worth in science and technology. You have seen how GPS data, collected every second, can be used in the same way as the $\\vec{x}(t)$ kinematic equation. In particular, you are suspicious of the assumption that the treadmill increases its velocity infinitely fast. You decide to do a dynamics simulation to improve your predictions."
