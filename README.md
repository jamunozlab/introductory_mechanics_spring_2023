# Introductory Mechanics: projects and exercises in python

This repository includes 14 exercises and 6 projects written in python and easily accessible as Jupyter Notebooks that were used in several sections of a calculus-based introductory mechanics course for scientists and engineers at The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) in Fall 2022 and Spring 2023. The aim is to reinforce, through the structure and reuse of code, the relationships and commonalities of the main quantities of mechanics: position, velocity, acceleration, force, energy, momentum, torque, moment of inertia, angular momentum, etc. Knowledge of programming is not assumed nor required, but basic python constructions such as loops and functions were explained to the students.

The exercises and projects consist of a short introduction, code, and several questions. In the case of the exercises, the questions can be answered by changing the values of certain variables in the code, but no new code needs to be written. For projects, it is sometimes necessary to write a few lines of code, but several examples that require only slightly modifications are provided. At UTEP, the exercises were completed in teams of 3 students in a 1-hour per week “workshop” session and the projects were assigned as homework every two weeks and were completed in teams of 2 students.

Feedback from the students made apparent that often they did not see the connection between the exercises and the physics concepts being taught in class. Several word problems similar to those in Ref. [1] that resemble the coding exercises are included in this repository. Including them in the weekly problem sets and pointing them out to the students ameliorated the situation. Future versions of this work will include videos and Notebooks that will improve the integration between the physics concepts as taught in lecture and as taught in code.
